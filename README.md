## Description

This repository of our project dedicated to the exploration and application of Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This project aims to study and compare the capabilities and performance of these models on two distinct databases: Alphadigits and MNIST.


## Data

The project uses two well-known machine learning databases:
1. Alphadigits: This database contains alphanumeric characters and is used to test the models' ability to generalize and recognize complex shapes.
2. MNIST: The famous MNIST database of handwritten digits is used to evaluate the performance of models in digit recognition.

## Notebooks üìä

The repository contains four Jupyter Notebooks, each with a specific purpose:

1. Preliminary Tests ([First_tests.ipynb](First_tests.ipynb)): This notebook presents the initial tests performed on the models. It serves as an introduction to the RBM, DBN and DNN architectures and their implementation.

2. Alphadigits study ([Alpha_digits.ipynb](Alpha_digits.ipynb)): This notebook focuses on the application and evaluation of models on the Alphadigits database. It explores the ability of models to learn and generate alphanumeric characters.

3. Study on MNIST ([MNIST.ipynb](MNIST.ipynb)): In this notebook, models are applied to the MNIST database. The aim is to evaluate their accuracy and efficiency in recognizing handwritten digits.

4. Comparison of Generative Capabilities ([Comparison.ipynb](comparison.ipynb)): This final notebook offers an in-depth comparison between the generative capabilities of an MBR, a DBN and a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). It aims to identify the strengths and limitations of each model in terms of image generation.
